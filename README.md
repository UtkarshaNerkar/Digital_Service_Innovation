# Digital_Service_Innovation
A course that exposes to design thinking, service thinking, and the methods and practices used by lean startups working to create a minimum viable product (MVP)

I learnt about value-creation in the service sector and a human-centered design process including brainstorming, story-boarding, interviewing, video sketches, and pitching. In a team of 4, we conceived a digital service and assessed its technical feasibility, financial viability, and desirability. We produced a plan with a business model and a video sketch and pitched it to industry professionals.
